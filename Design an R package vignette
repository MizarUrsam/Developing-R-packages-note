Design an R package vignette
This document is the vignette skeleton dist_conversion.Rmd created in the last exercise. It includes the most familiar parts of an R Markdown document:

A YAML header that contains some metadata
Narrative text written in Markdown
R code chunks surrounded by ```{r} and ```; a syntax that comes from the knitr package
To develop package documentation for the unitConverter package, it is vital to show users many different ways to work with the functionality of the package. Vignettes serve that purpose in both showing examples and also adding explanatory text and clarifications in an easy-to-read format.

Instructions
Create a heading on line 22 of "Convert feet to meters" with no subheadings.
Add "We can use the package to convert 5 feet into meters as follows." after the the heading, leading one line of space.
In the dist-example chunk, make the appropriate call to the dist_converter() function to achieve the task you have described.
At the end, output the result inline with "Five feet is r dist_result meters."

# Convert feet to meters

We can use the package to convert 5 feet into meters as follows.

```{r dist-example}
dist_result <- dist_converter(dist_value = 5, unit_from = "feet", unit_to = "meters")
```

Five feet is `r dist_result` meters.





####--------Build package vignettes--------####

Using Knit HTML (or rmarkdown::render()) is one way to test the build-ability of your vignette. 
It is best to use the devtools package functionality to build all vignettes. 
Doing so allows you to automatically build and update the vignettes, 
ensuring that they are always up to date with the latest changes in your unitConverter package. 
This simplifies the workflow of creating, testing, and maintaining vignettes, saving time and effort in the documentation process.

The devtools package has been loaded for you along with the package so far, including both dist_conversion.Rmd and func_conversion.Rmd files.
